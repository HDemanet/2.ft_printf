# ft_printf  

For the **ft_printf** project of the 42 school curriculum, the goal is to recreate the famous C library function `printf()`.  
This project is an excellent opportunity to dive deeper into C programming, particularly variadic functions, and to learn how to handle multiple data types and conversions efficiently.  

The project emphasizes well-structured and extensible code, preparing students for more advanced coding challenges in the future.
